## What here?

Hardware Info (HW Info) is a set of data about your computer that helps for creating anti-vm scripts. Typical info collected includes:

- **MAC Address** — the unique ID of your network interface, basically your network card’s passport.
- **IP Address** — your local network address, so other devices know where to find you.
- **Running Processes** — a list of programs currently running and hogging your resources.
- **Active Services** — system services that keep your OS and applications up and running.
- **Serial Numbers of BIOS, Motherboard, CPU, and Disks** — unique hardware codes, like a vehicle’s VIN.
- **UUID and MachineGuid** — universal unique identifiers for your device, nearly impossible to fake.
- **GPU and CPU Info** — the main motor and graphics engine of your system.
- **Computer Name and Username** — to know who owns the machine.
- **Operating System Version** — to understand which system you’re dealing with.
